### TO-DO List
 - Error handling
 - Animations for loading
 - juice up the UI. Try lottie Air BnB lib perhaps?
 - back button, gesture
 - Bug - when starting up, if a joke was already liked, we check the like check box, this triggers an action which likes it again, causing it to get pushed on the favourites list again
