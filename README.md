### TO-DO List
 - Animations for loading
 - juice up the UI. Try lottie Air BnB lib perhaps?
 - back button, gesture
 - Bug - pagination, when we reach the end of the list of favourites, we load more jokes from the DB. The list is reset to the top of the listview and not from the current point
 - Bug - when starting up, if a joke was already liked, we check the like check box, this triggers an action which likes it again, causing it to get pushed on the favourites list again
